Breaking changes:

* Overhauled exception hierarchy
 ** New exception class: `U2fCeremonyException`
 ** New exception class: `U2fRegistrationException extends U2fCeremonyException`
 ** New exception class: `U2fAuthenticationException extends U2fCeremonyException`
 ** The following exception classes now extend `U2fAuthenticationException`:
  *** `DeviceCompromisedException`
  *** `InvalidDeviceCounterException`
  *** `NoEligableDevicesException`
  *** `NoEligibleDevicesException`
 ** `U2fBadConfigurationException` is now a checked exception
 ** `U2fBadInputException` is now a checked exception, and is no longer thrown directly by the methods of `U2F`.
  *** Methods of `U2F` now catch this exception and wrap it in a `U2fRegistrationException` or ``U2fAuthenticationException`.
* `DeviceRegistration.getAttestationCertificate()` now returns `null` instead of throwing `NoSuchFieldException`
* `static ClientData.getString(JsonNode, String)` now throws `U2fBadInputException` instead of `NullPointerException`, or if the returned field is not a `String` value
* Some `AssertionError`s and `IllegalArgumentException`s are now `U2fBadInputException`s instead


Improvements:

* `BouncyCastleCrypto` now throws more descriptive exceptions


Bug fixes:

* Improved error handling in client data input validation
