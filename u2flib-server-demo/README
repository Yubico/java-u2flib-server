== u2flib-server-demo
A simple self-contained demo server supporting multiple devices per user. The central part is the
https://github.com/Yubico/java-u2flib-server/blob/master/u2flib-server-demo/src/main/java/demo/Resource.java[Resource]
class.

=== 1. Clone
 git clone https://github.com/Yubico/java-u2flib-server.git

=== 2. Compile
Go to the demo server directory:
 
 cd java-u2flib-server/u2flib-server-demo

Compile using `mvn clean install` and then run using
`java -jar target/u2flib-server-demo.jar server config.yml`.

=== 3. Run
Then point a U2F-compatible web browser (e.g. Chrome) to
link:https://localhost:8443/assets/registerIndex.html[https://localhost:8443/assets/registerIndex.html].

NOTE: Since U2F requires a HTTPS connection, this demo server uses a dummy certificate.
This will cause Chrome to show a warning, which it is safe to bypass.

.Q&A
Why do I get https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Libraries/Client_error_codes.html[error code 2]?::
    You are accessing the server using a URL that does not match the server's
	https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html[App ID].
	The App ID is set to `https://localhost:8443` by default, but you can change this in the
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-u2flib-server/blob/master/u2flib-server-demo/src/main/java/demo/Resource.java[Resource]
    class.
